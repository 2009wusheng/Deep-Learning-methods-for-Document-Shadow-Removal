## üìñ Project Overview

This project focuses on AI-powered document shadow removal to enhance document digitization quality. Shadows frequently occur on scanned or photographed documents due to uneven lighting, paper folds, or object coverage during capture, significantly degrading content quality and impairing both human readability and machine-driven information extraction.

**Group Members:**  Zhibo Hu, Xinyue Zhao

## üéØ Project Significance

- **Problem**: Shadows reduce document readability, impair information extraction, and undermine archival value
- **Solution**: Advanced deep learning models for effective shadow removal while preserving document content
- **Innovation**: Custom DSR dataset generation and specialized model fine-tuning for real-world applications

## üîç Evaluated Methods

### Traditional Methods (Baseline)
- **Adaptive Thresholding**: Dynamic local threshold calculation
  - Limitations: Color information loss, over-removed background, visible borders
- **Gamma Correction**: Binarization with contrast enhancement
  - Limitations: Color distortion, content detail loss on complex documents

### Deep Learning Methods (SOTA)

#### 1. SpA-Former (2022 - Ranked #7)
- GAN-based architecture
- Vision Transformer Encoder
- Gated Feed-Forward Network
- Lightweight (0.47MB)

#### 2. DC-ShadowNet (2022 - Ranked #5)
- GAN-based approach
- Domain classifier integration
- Multiple shadow-specific losses
- Unsupervised learning capability

#### 3. ShadowFormer (2023 - Ranked #1) - **Best Performer**
- **Channel Attention**: Efficient global information capture
- **Shadow-Interaction Attention**: 
  - Resizes shadow mask to feature map size
  - Categorizes patches into shadow/non-shadow regions
  - Exploits correlation maps between regions
  - Reweights attention to emphasize similarity

## üìä Dataset: Document Shadow Removal (DSR)

### Custom Dataset Generation using Blender
- **150 training sets** + **50 testing sets**
- Each set contains: shadowed image, shadow mask, and non-shadow image
- Enhanced diversity through strategic variations:

#### Diversity Strategies:
1. **Material Variation**: Different document textures applied to 3D paper models
2. **Shadow Complexity**: Various 3D model shapes generating diverse shadow patterns
3. **Dynamic Lighting**: Adjustable light sources creating realistic illumination conditions

#### Lighting Scenarios:
- Single Strong Light Source: Sharp, well-defined shadows
- Strong + Weak Light Source: Uneven shadow coloration with subtle illumination
- Single Moderate Light Source: Soft, blurred shadow edges
- Multiple Light Sources: Overlapping shadows with mixed edge sharpness

## ‚öôÔ∏è Evaluation Methodology

### Dataset: ISTD Test Dataset
- Standard benchmark for shadow removal evaluation

### Quantitative Metrics:
- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**: Objective visual error measurement (higher = better)
- **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**: Image similarity assessment (higher = better)

### Qualitative Assessment:
- Visual comparison of shadow removal effectiveness
- Content preservation evaluation
- Border artifact analysis

## üìà Results

### Quantitative Evaluation on ISTD Dataset

| Model | PSNR (‚Üë) | SSIM (‚Üë) | 
|-------|----------|----------|
| SpA-Former | 29.09 | 0.71 |
| DC-ShadowNet | 28.67 | 0.68 |
| **ShadowFormer** | **28.23** | **0.96** |

### Fine-tuning Results (Custom DSR Dataset)

| Model | PSNR (‚Üë) | SSIM (‚Üë) | 
|-------|----------|----------|
| ShadowFormer (Original) | 19.50 | 0.79 |
| **ShadowFormer (Fine-tuned)** | **26.06** | **0.94** |

### Key Findings:
1. **ShadowFormer outperformed** all other models in both PSNR and SSIM metrics
2. **Fine-tuning significantly enhanced** performance on document-specific shadow removal
3. **Custom DSR dataset** proved effective for domain-specific adaptation
4. **Lighting diversity** in training data improved model robustness
